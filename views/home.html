    <h2>What is CIRN?</h2>
    <br>

The Coastal Imaging Research Network (CIRN) is an international group of researchers who exploit visible signatures of phenomena in coastal, estuarine, and riverine environments. CIRN members develop new methodologies to gain a better fundamental understanding of the processes shaping those environments from imagery. Data are also used in an applied sense as inputs for model boundary and initial conditions through assimilation, to validate models, and to make management decisions. The network is a collaboration between researchers from 14 countries. CIRN has grown over the last 30 years from its origins in the Coastal Imaging Lab at Oregon State University and now includes investigators from universities, government labs and agencies, non-profits, and private companies.

    <h2>Still want to know more?</h2>
    <br>

Join us at the 1st Annual CIRN Bootcamp March 22-29, 2017 at the USACE Field Research Facility in Duck, NC.
<br>
<br>
The goal of the boot camp will be to provide both the background and hands on experience in working with coastal imaging for new users. Attendees will collect UAV data of the surf-zone at the FRF and process it using the UAV and cBathy toolboxes.
<br>
<br>
The boot camp will cover the history and development of coastal imaging, cameras and photogrammetry, lens distortion, UAV collection methods, sampling from video streams, solution methods for image geometry, common image products, and more sophisticated products like cBathy and vBar. 
<br>
<br>
Register for the bootcamp <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cirn-boot-camp-1-tickets-31685059867">HERE</a>.
