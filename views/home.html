    <h3>What is CIRN?</h3>
The Coastal Imaging Research Network (CIRN) is an international group of researchers who exploit visible signatures of phenomena in coastal, estuarine, and riverine environments. CIRN members develop new methodologies to gain a better fundamental understanding of the processes shaping those environments from imagery. Data are also used in an applied sense as inputs for model boundary and initial conditions through assimilation, to validate models, and to make management decisions. The network is a collaboration between researchers from 14 countries. The coastal imaging community has grown over the last 30 years from its origins in the Coastal Imaging Lab at Oregon State University and now includes investigators from universities, government labs and agencies, non-profits, and private companies. CIRN was officially formed in 2016 to provide an integrative, multi-institutional group to collaborate on remotely sensed data techniques.

    <h2>2023 CIRN Week ANNOUNCEMENT!!</h2>
    <br>
After a three-year hiatus, the Coastal Imaging Research Network (CIRN) is hosting its annual workshop at the USACE Field Research Facility in Duck, NC! The collaborative workshop is intended for novices as well as experts; there are bootcamps for camera set-up and data analysis as well as presentations of ongoing/novel research by participants. 
    <br>
The workshop, occurring on May 8-12, 2023, consists of a hands-on bootcamp (May 8-9) and presentation workshop (May 10-12). In addition, there will be additional CoastSnap workshop (May 8-9) and guiBathy bootcamp (May 9). Participants can attend one, some or all events at no cost. 
    <br>
Registration is required to attend any the events at the provided weblink (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cirn-week-2023-tickets-482406098627). Other information, such as reduced rate hotel block information and workshop agendas, can be found at this site as well. Questions can be directed to brittany.l.bruder@erdc.dren.mil.
