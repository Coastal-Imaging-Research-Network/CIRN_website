    <h3>What is CIRN?</h3>
The Coastal Imaging Research Network (CIRN) is an international group of researchers who exploit visible signatures of phenomena in coastal, estuarine, and riverine environments. CIRN members develop new methodologies to gain a better fundamental understanding of the processes shaping those environments from imagery. Data are also used in an applied sense as inputs for model boundary and initial conditions through assimilation, to validate models, and to make management decisions. The network is a collaboration between researchers from 14 countries. The coastal imaging community has grown over the last 30 years from its origins in the Coastal Imaging Lab at Oregon State University and now includes investigators from universities, government labs and agencies, non-profits, and private companies. CIRN was officially formed in 2016 to provide an integrative, multi-institutional group to collaborate on remotely sensed data techniques.

    <h2>2023 CIRN Week ANNOUNCEMENT!!</h2>
    <br>
The Coastal Imaging Research Network (CIRN) is hosting its annual workshop at the Water Research Laboratory, University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia! Thank you to Kristen Splinter and Mitch Harley for offering to host. The week will include two days of boot camp covering topics tentatively including CoastSat satellite imagery toolbox, Planet imagery analysis, image processing from mobile platforms, or other topics. If you have a toolbox or method you would like to share with the CIRN community as part of a boot camp, please send a message to coastalimagingresearchnetwork@gmail.com to express your interest in teaching a class. 
    <br>
    <br>
The meeting will be held October 21-25, 2025, and will consist of hands-on bootcamps (Oct 21-22) and a presentation workshop (Oct 23-25). Participants can attend one, some or all events at no cost. 
    <br>
    <br>
Registration is required to attend any of the events at the provided <a href="https://events.humanitix.com/cirn-week-2024">weblink</a>. Additional information about hotels and transportation can be found at this site as well. We look forward to seeing you in Australia!
