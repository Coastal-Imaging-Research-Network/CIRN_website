    <h2>What is CIRN?</h2>
    <br>

The Coastal Imaging Research Network (CIRN) is an international group of researchers who exploit visible signatures of phenomena in coastal, estuarine, and riverine environments. CIRN members develop new methodologies to gain a better fundamental understanding of the processes shaping those environments from imagery. Data are also used in an applied sense as inputs for model boundary and initial conditions through assimilation, to validate models, and to make management decisions. The network is a collaboration between researchers from 14 countries. The coastal imaging community has grown over the last 30 years from its origins in the Coastal Imaging Lab at Oregon State University and now includes investigators from universities, government labs and agencies, non-profits, and private companies. CIRN was officially formed in 2016 to provide an integrative, multi-institutional group to collaborate on remotely sensed data techniques.

    <h2>SPRING BOOTCAMP AND WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT!!</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>CIRN Bootcamp: June 4-5, 2018, St. Petersburg, FL </h3>
The CIRN Bootcamp will provide both the background and hands on experience in working with coastal imaging for new users. Attendees will work with image data of the surf-zone and learn how to process and analyze the data using the UAV and cBathy toolboxes.
<br>
<br>
The bootcamp will cover the development of coastal imaging, cameras and photogrammetry, lens distortion, UAV/single camera collection methods, sampling from video streams, solution methods for image geometry, common image products, and nearshore data analysis with imagery.
